# COLLEGE SAMAJ


## This is our idea which is basically a social platform for all the stuff related to college. 


* It isn't just a boring academic college application ,but an interactive application with modern interactive UI
*  which will also be a place for the students to interact, and all the updates formal and informal will also be available on that platform.  

* Basically it would ease the process of getting accustomed for the newely arrived first year students.

##

# OUR PLATFORM OFFERS :
 
 * A dashbord for the User exclusive to the student of IIIT VADODARA STUDENT

 * On the profile the Student can enter his/ her tech stack (or what is he/she working on) so juniors could seek help from the seniors or collaborate with ease. 

 * It would also have a place for the students to gossip around.

 * An update section which would have current updates based on the year of study of the student.

 * details of all the necessary profiles/ social media handels that is associated with the institute and is neeeded to be followed.



# NOTE : 

### although we came with this idea of "COLLEGE SAMAJ" during our first hackathon (HACKIIITV) we weren't able to implement it because of our lack of our expertise in the domain of web devlopment we didn't even knew HTML and CSS before the hackathon  all we did and implemented in this project was learnt during the Hackathon.
