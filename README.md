## Development Note

During our participation in the first hackathon ( HACKIIITV ), the idea for College Samaj was conceived. Despite our limited expertise in web development, with no prior knowledge of HTML and CSS, we successfully implemented the project during the hackathon. This platform aims to simplify the onboarding process for new students, providing a holistic and engaging college experience.
